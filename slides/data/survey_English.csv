For example, I can select one way ANOVA and input a factor and choose multiple dependent variables to test and I receive output for all of them at once. With R, as far as I know, you have to run each ANOVA separately. I find it’s just a lot easier to have all the results in front of me at the one time. Another thing I prefer SPSS for is long to wide format restructuring. SPSS automatically puts variables that have the same value for all observations for each ID into a single variable, whereas transposing in R will create x variables for all variables regardless. For example, participant sex would be one column in the resultant SPSS wide format data set. But in R, there would be x number of sex columns, where x is the number of observations.
